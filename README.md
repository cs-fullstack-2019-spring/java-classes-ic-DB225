# Java Classes Practice

Create a new package ```com.company.practice```

### Exercise 1:

In the ```com.company.practice``` create a new Java Class called ```Person``` (you can use the included ```Person.java``` file) in the ```com.company.practice``` package.

From the ```Main``` class, create (at least) 3 instances of Person from the Person class and perform the following operations:

1. Use the Person.printPerson() method to print the People
2. Write the code to set their name, age, height, and weight
3. Use the Person.printPerson() method to print the People and verify your changes
4. Use the method Person.bodyMassindex to along with your own code to print each Person's name, age, and Body Mass Index (BMI)

Extra: 
Add the code to load all the People into an ArrayList. Add code that will allow the user to enter a number and if within range, retrieve the Person instance at that position in the ArrayList and display their info.

### Exercise 2:

Create a simple Bank Account class called```Account``` in your ```com.company.practice``` package.

* An account should maintain a balance and have (customer) name
* An Account should provide methods to get the current balance, make a deposit, and make a withdrawl

- Withdraw 100.0 from KGibbs account
- Deposit 100.0 to KYancy account
