# Java Classes Practice

Create a new package ```com.company.practice```

### Exercise 1:

In the ```com.company.practice``` create a new Java Class called ```Person``` (you can use the included ```Person.java``` file) in the ```com.company.practice``` package.

From the ```Main``` class, create (at least) 3 instances of Person from the Person class and perform the following operations:

1. Use the Person.printPerson() method to print the People
2. Write the code to set their name, age, height, and weight
3. Use the Person.printPerson() method to print the People and verify your changes
4. Use the method Person.bodyMassindex to along with your own code to print each Person's name, age, and Body Mass Index (BMI)

Extra: 
Add the code to load all the People into an ArrayList. Add code that will allow the user to enter a number and if within range, retrieve the Person instance at that position in the ArrayList and display their info.

### Exercise 2:

Create a simple Point class called```Point``` in your ```com.company.practice``` package.

* EachPoint should have an ```x``` and a ```y``` property
* A Point should provide methods to get the current X and/or Y properties, and print out the Point (hint: toString)

- Create 3 points, print them out using the print method fromthe class
- Load the 3 points into an ArrayList, and print the 3 points by iterating the ArrayList
